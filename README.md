In order to provide a much more contextually useful and substantive replacement for final league tables, this is an attempt to create a week by week graphic of league positions for individual Premier League seasons. 

Inspired by watching a video of Liverpool losing to Crystal Palace 3-3. And how looking at the final table doesn't exactly communicate how brutal that draw and the preceding loss to Chelsea changed the shape of the league and how Manchester City's win was such an advantageous pipping of the league title.
